Introducing "100Editors: The Ultimate Proofreading Tool" 📚🎮

Welcome to the captivating world of 100Editors, a groundbreaking multiplayer puzzle browser game where linguistic prowess meets collaborative strategy. In 100Editors, players embark on an exhilarating journey through the intricacies of grammar, syntax, and language precision.

🧰 **Powered by Modern Technologies:** "100Editors" leverages the cutting-edge capabilities of Next.js, the elegance of Tailwind CSS, the type safety of TypeScript, and the robustness of Convex as our backend. This amalgamation of technologies ensures a seamless and immersive gaming experience.

📖 **The Objective:** Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to scour through a sea of text passages, meticulously hunting down grammatical errors that have been cunningly concealed within. These errors encompass sentence fragments, run-on sentences, subject-verb disagreements, pronoun-antecedent mismatches, elusive pronoun references, slippery shifts in pronouns and verb tenses, and an array of other linguistic enigmas.

⏳ **Race Against Time:** But here's the twist—time is of the essence. In 100Editors, players must utilize their linguistic acumen under a ticking clock. With every passing moment, the stakes grow higher, and the pressure intensifies.

🤝 **Collaborative or Solo Gameplay:** Whether you prefer collaborative or solo adventures, 100Editors caters to your gaming style. Team up with fellow grammar enthusiasts for a synchronized linguistic pursuit, or embark on a solo quest to prove your mastery of the language arts.

🏆 **Common Win Conditions:** In 100Editors, success is a collective endeavor. Players must collaborate seamlessly to achieve common win conditions based on a set of meticulously crafted rules. The rules serve as your guiding compass, providing the framework to identify and correct grammatical imperfections.

🎉 **Victory or Defeat Together:** The beauty of 100Editors lies in its cooperative spirit, but the challenge is equally rewarding when taken solo. Win as a team, or face defeat together, or triumph as a lone grammar virtuoso—the choice is yours.

🔐 **Incorporating the Password Game:** Drawing inspiration from the structure of the Password Game, we've transformed grammatical errors into the foundation of our tool feautures. Just as you'd adhere to the Password Game's rules, you'll navigate 100Editors using similar principles, turning grammatical precision into an engaging puzzle-solving adventure.

🚀 **A Hackathon Innovation:** "100Editors" is the brainchild of a two-week hackathon project sponsored by Convex and Web Dev Cody. This collaborative endeavor brings together a community of dedicated developers and grammar enthusiasts to deliver an innovative tool experience.

Prepare to embark on an unforgettable journey into the heart of language, where victory is born from unity, wit, and a shared love for the art of grammar. 100Editors awaits, ready to challenge your linguistic mettle like never before. Are you up for the ultimate proofreader's challenge, alone or with a team?
